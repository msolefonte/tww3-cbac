Cost-based Army Caps mod for Total War: Warhammer III.

## Introduction

Approved port of Jadawin's [Cost-based Army Caps](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1723390103) for
Warhammer II.

This mod introduces an economic cap to the campaign armies in a very similar fashion than Multiplayer Battles do, hence
removing the viability of elite doomstacks and increasing that of basic units without being limited by types or tiers.
The change affects both the player and the AI, although by default the human limited will be smaller.

If the total point cost of the army exceeds the limit, it will cost 3x the normal upkeep and will be unable to replenish
until it is again under the cost limit. Worry not, limits are programmed to be dynamic by default, which means a higher
level lord will be able to handle a more expensive army. All the values can be modified using MCT.
